# Presentation

**Slides**: Replace the placeholder link with the filename of your exported presentation (for example `slides/presentation_slides.pdf` or `presentation.ipynb`).

Example:

- `[Slides](slides/presentation_slides.pdf)`

Place the exported slides file in the `4_Presentation/` folder or update the link to point to the correct path in the repository.
